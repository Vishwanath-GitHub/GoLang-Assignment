When we are creating an interface and declaring some functions in it, it is necessary to implement and use all of the functions declared.
If we ommit some of the functions, GoLang will throw an error. An example is this if we don't use display():

    per.display undefined (type person has no field or method display)
    
It is important to note that an interface is a contract that guarantees that a class implements all the properties and functions defined in the interface. However we don't have any classes in GoLang, interface is its replacement.
